          <p className={styles.desc}>
            Our vision is rooted in the belief that education is essential for every family and represents the best investment for prosperity, health, and independence. BGS strongly supports the rights of parents and learners to make informed choices about education. 
            In many countries, education systems are constrained by limited resources often receiving less than 5% of national GDP. In response, BGS is committed to: Ensuring inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all Promoting lifelong learning opportunities Advancing innovative, skill-based, and flexible learning models 
            We envision a world where learners regardless of their location can access world-class education that prepares them for success in a rapidly changing global environment.

            Level-based qualifications follow a structured progression pathway, allowing students to advance step by step—from foundational to doctoral-level studies—based on their pace, goals, and existing qualifications. 
            This modular system adheres to recognized qualification frameworks such as the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) in the United Kingdom, the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), and the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). 
            These frameworks ensure that each level corresponds to a specific set of academic outcomes and practical competencies. This structure offers significant flexibility. 
            Learners can start at the level appropriate to their background, complete one stage, and then progress to the next while gaining relevant work experience. 
            This approach encourages Work-Integrated Learning (WIL), a model that combines theoretical instruction with real-world application, enabling students to immediately use their knowledge in professional settings.
